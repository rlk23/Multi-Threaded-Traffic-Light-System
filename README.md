# Multi-Threaded Traffic Light System

Explore the world of parallel programming and traffic simulation with a robust multi-threaded traffic light system. This project models dynamic intersections using threads, synchronization, and parallel programming paradigms to simulate realistic traffic scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Traffic Simulation**: Realistic vehicle behavior and interaction with traffic lights.
- **Thread-Based Synchronization**: Efficient thread management using mutexes and condition variables.
- **Queue-Based Coordination**: Organized vehicle queues ensuring smooth and fair traffic flow.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Observe traffic patterns and intersection behavior in real-time.
- **Performance Optimization**: Scalability through advanced algorithms and resource management.

## Implementation
1. **Thread-Based Approach**: Cars and traffic lights are simulated using individual threads synchronized with traffic light states.
2. **Queue-Based Approach**: Vehicles are organized in queues, processed in order, ensuring orderly traffic flow at intersections.
3. **Synchronization Techniques**: Leveraging mutexes and condition variables to maintain data integrity and prevent race conditions.

## Pros and Cons
- **Thread-Based**: Offers realism but adds complexity with traffic light synchronization.
- **Queue-Based**: Simpler to implement but may lack synchronization with traffic lights, impacting realism.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of AI-driven traffic light control for adaptive signal timing.
- Advanced traffic models incorporating acceleration, deceleration, and lane-changing behavior.
- Interactive visualization tools for deeper insights into traffic dynamics.
